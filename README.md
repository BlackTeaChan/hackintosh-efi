# hackintosh-efi

This is my current Clover configuration for macOS 10.12 and 10.15.

Hardware:
* Mainboard: Intel DH77DF
* CPU: Intel Core i7
* Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 2047 MB

What works:
* Sound (both HDMI and all other in/outputs)
* 4k at 60Hz using a DP-to-HDMI 2.0 adapter
# All USB ports (including USB 3.0)
* Basically everything else except sleep (worked in 10.11 and in 10.15)

> As soon as NVIDIA provides web drivers for 10.15, I'll definitely update :-)
